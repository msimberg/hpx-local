pika is a C++ library for concurrency and parallelism. It implements
senders/receivers (as proposed in `P2300 <https://wg21.link/p2300>`) for CPU
thread pools, MPI, and CUDA.

pika is a fork of `HPX <https://hpx.stellar-group.org>`_ focusing on the
single-node use case complemented by minimal MPI support.
